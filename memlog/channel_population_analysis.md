# Channel Population Analysis

## Issue Summary
Channels not populating properly in the EPG collection view, specifically Horror and Comedy channels showing no listings despite async loading implementation.

## Code Analysis Results

### 1. **Root Cause: Race Condition in Snapshot Updates**

**Problem**: The `fetchListings` method operates on background threads and updates the snapshot concurrently, causing data corruption.

**Current Implementation Issues**:
```swift
// Line 467-490: fetchListings calls on background thread
// Each channel gets staggered delays but all update same snapshot concurrently
```

**Evidence**: 
- Serial queue `snapshotUpdateQueue` was added but nested incorrectly inside `DispatchQueue.main.async`
- Multiple async operations modify the same snapshot simultaneously

### 2. **Identified Problems**

#### A. Nested Queue Issues (Lines 467-490)
```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    self.snapshotUpdateQueue.async {  // ❌ WRONG: Serial queue nested inside main queue
        // snapshot updates
        DispatchQueue.main.async {    // ❌ WRONG: Another main queue call inside serial queue
            self.epgDataSource.apply(currentSnapshot, animatingDifferences: true)
        }
    }
}
```

#### B. Channel Reference Mismatch
The code updates `channels[sectionIndex]` but uses `self.channels[sectionIndex]` in the snapshot, potentially causing reference mismatches.

#### C. Defensive Bounds Checking Insufficient
While bounds checking was added, the core issue is the async timing and queue management.

### 3. **Data Flow Issues**

1. **Initial Setup**: Creates 80 channels (8 genres × 10 channels each) with empty listings
2. **Async Loading**: All 80 channels start loading with staggered 0.05s delays
3. **Update Process**: Each completion tries to update the snapshot simultaneously
4. **Result**: Some channels succeed, others fail due to snapshot corruption

### 4. **Specific Failure Pattern**
- Sports channels appear to populate (mentioned in conversation summary)
- Horror and Comedy channels consistently fail
- This suggests timing-dependent race condition

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Fix: Proper Queue Management
1. Remove nested queue calls
2. Use serial queue for all snapshot operations
3. Ensure atomic updates

### Long-term Improvements
1. Batch snapshot updates instead of individual channel updates
2. Add retry mechanism for failed updates
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Consider using actors (iOS 15+) for thread-safe data management

## Current Status
- Defensive programming added but doesn't address core race condition
- Serial queue implemented incorrectly
- Index bounds checking working but masking the real issue

## Next Steps
1. Fix queue nesting in fetchListings method
2. Test with consistent channel population
3. Add proper error recovery
4. Implement batch updates for better performance
