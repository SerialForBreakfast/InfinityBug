//  ========================================================================
//  INFINITYBUG EXPLORATION & INSTRUMENTATION SUITE (NO PASS/FAIL GUARANTEES)
//  ========================================================================
//
//  NOTE 2025-06-22: Automated reproduction has proven unreliable in UITest
//  environment because XCUIRemote sends **synthetic events** that bypass the
//  HID layer, VoiceOver cannot be toggled programmatically, and the test
//  runner throttles event delivery to ~15 Hz. The current goal is **NOT to
//  assert pass/fail**, but to capture metrics and video so a human can judge
//  whether InfinityBug occurs under each stress profile.
//
//  Each test therefore:
//    • Verifies the FocusStress harness is present.
//    • Sends a predefined press pattern while periodically sampling focus or
//      logging AXFocusDebugger output.
//    • NEVER fails due to InfinityBug absence; instead it records metrics in
//      the console and XCTActivity attachments.
//
//  Tests emit warnings when running on Simulator to remind that synthetic input
//  limits reproduction fidelity. No environment flag is required.
//
//  **OVERALL STRATEGY:**
//  This test suite implements a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to reproducing
//  the tvOS "InfinityBug" - a focus system failure that causes infinite directional
//  press repetition and system-wide focus lock-ups. The strategy combines:
//
//  1. **STRESS MULTIPLICATION:** Uses FocusStressViewController with 8 simultaneous
//     stressor categories to create the "perfect storm" conditions
//
//  2. **TIMING PRECISION:** Implements exact timing patterns (8-50ms intervals)
//     observed during successful manual InfinityBug reproduction
//
//  3. **PATTERN REPLICATION:** Recreates specific input sequences that have
//     previously triggered InfinityBug in manual testing
//
//  4. **AUTOMATED DETECTION:** Uses InfinityBugDetector to identify the "Black Hole"
//     condition where many presses occur with zero focus changes
//
//  5. **MANUAL VALIDATION:** Provides pure stress tests for human observation
//     when automated detection proves insufficient
//
//  **TEST HIERARCHY:**
//  - testFocusStressInfinityBugDetection: Primary reproduction test with detector
//  - testIndividualStressors: Scientific isolation of root causes
//  - testPhantomEventCacheBugReproduction: Targets phantom event manifestation
//  - testInfinityBugDetectorFeedingReproduction: Validates detector accuracy
//  - testMaximumStressForManualReproduction: Brute force manual reproduction
//  - testFocusStressPerformanceStress: Performance baseline establishment
//  - testFocusStressAccessibilitySetup: Infrastructure validation
//
//  **ROOT CAUSE THEORY:**
//  InfinityBug = (High-frequency input) × (Accessibility tree complexity) ×
//                (Layout instability) × (Focus guide conflicts) × (Timing precision)
//
//  The bug occurs when queued input events resolve against stale focus contexts,
//  causing the focus engine's fallback algorithm to lock onto circular focus guides
//  and infinitely replay the failed input event.
//
//  **EXPECTED OUTCOMES:**
//  - Most tests should PASS (no InfinityBug detected) under normal conditions
//  - Tests FAIL when InfinityBug is successfully reproduced
//  - Manual reproduction test always PASSES but requires human observation
//  - Failed tests indicate successful InfinityBug reproduction for further analysis

    /// 
    /// **1. FOCUS STRESS MODE ACTIVATION:**
    /// - `-FocusStressMode heavy` enables all 8 stressor categories simultaneously
    /// - This creates the "perfect storm" of conditions needed for InfinityBug reproduction
    /// - Heavy mode includes: nested layouts, hidden traps, jiggle timers, circular guides, duplicate IDs, 
    ///   dynamic guides, rapid layout changes, and overlapping elements
    ///
    /// **2. DEBOUNCE ELIMINATION:**
    /// - `-DebounceDisabled YES` and environment variable disable input debouncing
    /// - Critical because InfinityBug requires rapid input processing without artificial delays
    /// - Allows the high-frequency input patterns (8-50ms intervals) to reach the focus system
    ///
    /// **3. FOCUS TEST MODE:**
    /// - `-FocusTestMode YES` enables enhanced logging and monitoring
    /// - Activates the InfinityBugDetector for automated detection
    /// - Provides detailed focus change tracking for test validation
    ///
    /// **4. DETECTOR RESET:**
    /// - `-ResetBugDetector` ensures clean state between test runs
    /// - Prevents false positives from previous test execution
    /// - Critical for reliable automated detection
    ///
    /// **5. STRESS FACTOR SCALING:**
    /// - Environment variable `STRESS_FACTOR` allows intensity scaling
    /// - Default = 1 (200 presses), can be increased for more aggressive testing
    /// - Enables performance testing across different device capabilities
    ///
    /// **VALIDATION:**
    /// - 3-second wait allows all stressors to initialize completely
