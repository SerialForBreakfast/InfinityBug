# HammerTime Tasks & Progress

## Current Sprint: Rule Compliance & InfinityBug Detection

### High Priority Tasks

#### ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Create memlog folder structure** 
  - Created `changelog.md`, `directory_tree.md`, `tasks.md`
  - Established project state tracking system
  - **Completed**: 2025-01-27

- [x] **Fix compilation errors**
  - Resolved switch exhaustiveness issues
  - Removed duplicate method overrides
  - Fixed property reference errors
  - **Completed**: Previous session

- [x] **Remove emoji violations** (Rule #9)
  - Replaced all emojis with professional text alternatives
  - Files: `Debugger.swift`, `ViewController.swift`, `HammerTimeUITests.swift`
  - **Completed**: 2025-01-27

#### CRITICAL (Must fix immediately)
- [ ] **Document concurrency requirements** (Rules #4-5)
  - Add concurrency documentation to `DispatchQueue.main.async` calls
  - Files: `Debugger.swift`, `AppDelegate.swift`, `ContainerFactory.swift`
  - Explain thread safety and component interactions

#### HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] **Standardize access levels** (Rule #6)
  - Review all properties and methods for explicit access modifiers
  - Focus on `ContainerFactory` and `Debugger` public interfaces

- [ ] **Complete Xcode QuickHelp documentation** (Rule #2)
  - Add parameter and return value documentation
  - Standardize comment format across all public methods

#### CRITICAL TASK 6: Focus Stress Harness & Debug Menu
**Prompt (DEV‚Äëonly code):**  
* Create `FocusStressViewController` guarded by `#if DEBUG`.  
* Hard‚Äëenable these stressors:  
  1. 3‚Äëlevel nested compositional `UICollectionView`s.  
  2. ‚â• 50 hidden but `isAccessibilityElement == true` traps.  
  3. Timer (`0.05 s`) toggling a top constraint constant (jiggle).  
  4. Two circular `UIFocusGuide`s linking to each other.  
  5. Duplicate `accessibilityIdentifier` on 30 % of cells.  
* Provide `struct StressFlags` with Bool toggles + launch arg `-FocusStressMode heavy|light` (`heavy` = all on, `light` = 1 & 2 only).  
* Add `DebugMenuViewController` (also `#if DEBUG`) shown when app starts with `-ShowDebugMenu YES`. Menu rows: "Default App Flow" and "Focus Stress (heavy|light)".  

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
* `-FocusStressMode heavy` launches the stress harness with every stressor live; `light` enables only flags 1 & 2.  
* `-ShowDebugMenu YES` shows the menu; selecting a row navigates correctly via remote & VoiceOver.  
* No DEBUG code included in RELEASE build.  
* All new types/functions have QuickHelp comments.

#### ‚úÖ COMPLETED - CRITICAL TASK 7: Focus Stress UITest Suite
**Status:** COMPLETED with major evolution - 2025-01-22

**Final Implementation:**
* Created comprehensive `FocusStressUITests` with 6 experimental test methods
* Resolved all XCUITest compilation errors using verified APIs only
* Implemented `RemoteCommandBehaviors` helper with realistic navigation patterns
* Added focus detection extensions using `hasFocus` property
* Shifted from pass/fail assertions to instrumentation and metrics collection

**Key Achievements:**
* All tests compile and run without errors on tvOS
* Realistic timing patterns (1-second delays vs microseconds)
* Edge detection with automatic direction reversal
* Performance-optimized focus tracking (limited to 10 cells)
* Comprehensive logging for manual analysis

**Test Suite:**
1. `testManualInfinityBugStress()` - Heavy manual stress (1200 presses)
2. `testPressIntervalSweep()` - Timing analysis across intervals
3. `testHiddenTrapDensityComparison()` - Accessibility complexity scaling
4. `testExponentialPressureScaling()` - Progressive interval reduction
5. `testEdgeFocusedNavigation()` - Boundary-aware navigation
6. `testMixedGestureNavigation()` - Combined button/swipe patterns

**Philosophy Shift:** Tests now serve as instrumentation tools for manual InfinityBug observation rather than automated pass/fail detection.
