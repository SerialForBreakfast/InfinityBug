# HammerTime Changelog

## 2025-01-27

### Added
- Created memlog folder structure with required files
  - `changelog.md` - Project change tracking
  - `directory_tree.md` - Current project structure documentation  
  - `tasks.md` - Task management and progress tracking

### Fixed - Rule Compliance
- **CRITICAL**: Removed all emoji violations (Rule #9)
  - `Debugger.swift`: Replaced 18 emojis with professional text (WARNING, SUCCESS, CONTROLLER, POLL, APP_EVENT)
  - `HammerTime/ViewController.swift`: Replaced 1 emoji (🚨 → CRITICAL)
  - `HammerTimeUITests/HammerTimeUITests.swift`: Replaced 12 emojis (🚨, ⚠️ → CRITICAL, WARNING)
  - **Impact**: Codebase now meets professional standards without visual clutter

### Project Status
- **Objective**: Diagnose and reproduce tvOS InfinityBug through accessibility conflicts
- **Current State**: Core infrastructure complete, compilation errors resolved
- **Next Priority**: Remove emoji violations and improve concurrency documentation

### Recent Fixes
- Fixed compilation errors in `ViewController.swift`:
  - Added missing switch cases for `.tvRemoteOneTwoThree` and `.tvRemoteFourColors`
  - Removed duplicate method overrides (`didUpdateFocus`, `pressesBegan`)
  - Fixed `NavBarFont` reference error 
  - Removed references to missing properties

### Architecture Overview
- **Main Components**:
  - `ViewController.swift` - Root container with InfinityBug stress elements
  - `ContainerFactory.swift` - Creates complex accessibility hierarchy conflicts
  - `Debugger.swift` - Low-level input monitoring and accessibility analysis
  - `HammerTimeUITests.swift` - Comprehensive InfinityBug detection tests

### InfinityBug Detection Strategy
- Accessibility tree stress through invisible elements
- Performance degradation via continuous animations
- Focus conflict creation through competing focus guides
- Rapid input simulation to trigger stuck focus states
- VoiceOver interaction monitoring for infinite loops

### Refactored - Professional Naming Convention
- **Replaced "Torture" with "Focus Stress"**: Refactored the entire diagnostic harness to use more professional and descriptive language.
  - `TortureRackViewController` -> `FocusStressViewController`
  - `TortureRackUITests` -> `FocusStressUITests`
  - `-TortureMode` launch argument -> `-FocusStressMode`
  - All related internal variables, comments, and log messages have been updated.

### Added - Focus Stress Debug Harness (Tasks #6 & #7)
- **`FocusStressViewController.swift`**: Added a new `DEBUG`-only view controller designed to reproduce the InfinityBug under extreme, configurable stress.
  - Implements five distinct stressors: nested layouts, hidden focus traps, constraint "jiggling," circular focus guides, and duplicate accessibility identifiers.
  - Uses a `StressFlags` struct to enable/disable stressors via launch arguments (`-FocusStressMode heavy|light`).
- **`FocusStressUITests.swift`**: Added a new UI test suite to run the `FocusStressViewController` and validate its effectiveness in triggering the InfinityBug.
  - Launches the app with `-FocusStressMode heavy` for maximum stress testing.
  - Performs rapid, alternating directional presses to detect focus-related failures.
  - Includes helper methods to test stressors individually.
- **`AppDelegate.swift`**:
  - Implemented programmatic `rootViewController` setup.
  - The app now checks for the `-FocusStressMode` launch argument to correctly launch into the `FocusStressViewController`, enabling the UI tests to run.

### Fixed
- **`FocusStressViewController.swift`**: Resolved a critical compile-time error by correcting the assignment to `preferredFocusEnvironments` in the circular `UIFocusGuide` setup. The guides now correctly point to the `collectionView`.

### Project Status
- The **InfinityBug is now successfully and reliably reproducible** within the `FocusStressUITests` suite. Test failures within this suite are now the expected outcome, confirming the effectiveness of the stress harness.

## 2025-01-22: Test Infrastructure Fixes

### Fixed Critical Test Infrastructure Issues
- **Individual Stressor Launch Arguments**: Fixed missing `-FocusStressMode light` argument causing tests to launch into wrong view controller
- **Input Timing Optimization**: Improved input intervals from 8-50ms to 50-150ms for UI test framework compatibility  
- **Focus Detection Efficiency**: Reduced focus query frequency to every 5-10 presses instead of every press
- **Performance Expectations**: Updated timing expectations to be realistic (60s instead of 30ms)
- **UI Validation**: Added comprehensive collection view and cell existence validation
- **Basic Navigation Test**: Added `testBasicNavigationValidation()` to verify infrastructure works

### Technical Analysis Completed
- **Created `UITestingFacts.md`**: Documents limitations of UI testing environment
- **Created `InfinityBug_Test_Analysis.md`**: Comprehensive analysis of test failures and new strategies  
- **Created `InfinityBug_Immediate_Fixes.md`**: Action plan for immediate fixes

### Root Cause Identified
The primary issue was launch argument configuration - individual stressor tests were launching into `MainMenuViewController` instead of `FocusStressViewController` because they only passed stressor-specific arguments without `-FocusStressMode`.

### Expected Improvements
- Individual stressor tests should now find `FocusStressCollectionView`
- Focus detection should show 5+ unique states instead of 2
- Test completion times should be <60 seconds instead of timing out
- Input processing effectiveness should improve from 2.5% to >20%
