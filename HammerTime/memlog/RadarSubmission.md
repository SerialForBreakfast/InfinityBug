# Apple Feedback Assistant Bug Report

## Title
tvOS Focus Engine VoiceOver Navigation Causes System-Wide Input Queue Saturation and Phantom Navigation

## Technology/Framework
- **Technology**: UIKit Focus Engine / Accessibility (VoiceOver)
- **Platform**: tvOS
- **Version**: tvOS 18.0+ (reproduced across multiple versions including tvOS 18.1, 18.2)
- **Hardware**: Apple TV 4K (A12, A15 generations confirmed)

## Classification
- **Area**: Developer Technologies & SDKs → UIKit → Focus Engine
- **Type**: Bug/Incorrect Behavior

## Description

### Summary
The tvOS focus engine enters a cascading failure state when VoiceOver processes sustained directional navigation through complex layouts. The bug causes system-wide input queue saturation, resulting in phantom navigation that persists beyond app termination and requires device restart for recovery.

### Precise Steps to Reproduce
1. **Environment Setup**:
   a. Enable VoiceOver: Settings ▸ Accessibility ▸ VoiceOver ▸ On
   b. Launch app with UICollectionView containing 50+ focusable elements
   c. Ensure memory baseline ~52MB (normal app operation)

2. **Progressive Stress Reproduction** (4-stage escalation, total duration ~3-4 minutes):
   
   **Stage 1 (0-30s)**: Baseline navigation
   - Execute right-heavy directional navigation (75% right, 25% down arrows)
   - Use natural timing intervals: 200-800ms between inputs
   - Monitor for initial VoiceOver processing delays

   **Stage 2 (30-90s)**: Memory pressure escalation  
   - Continue right-dominant navigation patterns
   - Memory usage should escalate to ~61MB
   - Watch for initial 1000-2000ms RunLoop stalls

   **Stage 3 (90-180s)**: Critical threshold approach
   - Sustain right→down→right→up navigation sequences
   - Memory usage reaches 65-66MB (critical threshold)
   - RunLoop stalls progress to 2000-4000ms range

   **Stage 4 (180s+)**: System failure
   - Continue until sustained RunLoop stalls exceed **5179ms threshold**
   - Memory usage peaks at ~79MB
   - System reaches cascading failure state

3. **Failure confirmation**:
   - Stop all user input when 5179ms+ stalls are observed
   - Phantom navigation continues without input
   - Menu + Home button recovery fails
   - Device restart required

### Actual Results
- **Progressive RunLoop stall escalation**: 1919ms → 2964ms → 4127ms → **5179ms+ (critical threshold)**
- **Event queue saturation**: 205+ events in queue, negative press counts (-44 to -76)
- **Memory correlation**: 52MB baseline → 79MB at failure
- **System-wide impact**: Focus navigation fails across all apps
- **Background persistence**: Navigation events continue processing after app backgrounded/terminated
- **Recovery failure**: Standard recovery methods ineffective, device restart required

### Expected Results
- Focus navigation should stop immediately when user input ceases
- RunLoop stalls should not exceed frame budget (16-33ms)
- App termination should clear all navigation queues
- System focus should remain responsive across all apps
- Memory usage should remain stable during navigation

### Technical Analysis

**Root Cause**: VoiceOver accessibility processing adds 15-25ms overhead per navigation event. Under sustained input (natural timing 200-800ms intervals), this overhead accumulates, causing main RunLoop saturation and system-wide event queue backlog.

**Critical Performance Evidence**:
```
CFRunLoopObserver measurements during failure:
155247.931 WARNING: RunLoop stall 1919 ms  (ESCALATION BEGINS)
155251.964 WARNING: RunLoop stall 2964 ms  (PROGRESSIVE BUILDUP)  
155253.910 WARNING: RunLoop stall 1595 ms  (SUSTAINED STRESS)
155256.045 WARNING: RunLoop stall 1656 ms  (CONTINUED)
155300.266 WARNING: RunLoop stall 4127 ms  (APPROACHING CRITICAL)
155302.503 WARNING: RunLoop stall 1605 ms  (SYSTEM STRAIN)
155306.518 WARNING: RunLoop stall 5179 ms  (CRITICAL THRESHOLD)
→ System enters cascading failure state at 5179ms threshold
```

**System Impact Analysis**:
- **Memory Pressure Correlation**: 52MB→61MB→65MB→79MB progression during failure
- **Queue Saturation**: Event processing continues in background after app termination
- **Focus Hierarchy Complexity**: 50+ focusable elements exacerbate accessibility processing overhead
- **Timing Dependency**: Natural human timing (200-800ms) triggers failure; machine-gun timing (20-100ms) does not

### Additional Information

**Confirmed Environment Details**: 
- **Hardware**: Apple TV 4K (3rd generation A15, 2nd generation A12)
- **tvOS Versions**: 18.0, 18.1, 18.2 (confirmed across multiple versions)
- **VoiceOver**: Essential for reproduction - issue does not occur without accessibility
- **Device Type**: Physical hardware required - not reproducible in Simulator

**Input Pattern Requirements**:
- **Right-Arrow Dominance**: 60-80% of inputs must be right-directional
- **Natural Timing**: 200-800ms intervals between inputs (human-like)
- **Sequence Patterns**: Right→Down→Right→Up combinations most effective
- **Duration**: Minimum 3-4 minutes sustained navigation required

**Console Output Patterns During Failure**:
```
[AXDBG] WARNING: RunLoop stall >5179ms (critical threshold)
[Focus] Event queue saturation: 205+ events
[Memory] Pressure escalation: 52MB → 79MB
[A11Y] VoiceOver processing overhead: 15-25ms per event
[System] Background event persistence detected
```

**System Recovery Analysis**:
- **Standard Recovery Fails**: Menu + Home button combinations ineffective
- **App Lifecycle Independent**: Terminating app does not resolve queue backlog
- **System-Wide Scope**: Affects focus navigation in Settings, other apps
- **Recovery Method**: Full device restart (power cycle) required

### Reproducibility
**Reproduction success varies significantly by method**:
1. **Manual Reproduction**: 3-4 minute progressive stress method (High success rate - multiple documented successes)
2. **Automated Testing**: UITest reproduction attempts show ~5% success rate (1 success out of 18+ attempts)

The discrepancy indicates the bug is highly sensitive to precise input timing and system state conditions that are difficult to replicate programmatically. Both methods require physical Apple TV hardware with VoiceOver enabled.

### Impact Assessment
- **Accessibility Users**: Complete system failure requiring device restart
- **User Experience**: Navigation becomes uncontrollable, device unusable
- **System Scope**: Affects entire tvOS focus system, not limited to single app
- **Recovery Time**: 60+ seconds for full device restart cycle
