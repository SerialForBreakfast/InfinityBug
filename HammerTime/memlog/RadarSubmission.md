# Apple Feedback Assistant Bug Report

## Title
tvOS VoiceOver Focus Navigation System Failure - Infinite Event Queue Overflow

## Classification
- Area: tvOS → Accessibility → VoiceOver
- Type: Critical Bug/System Failure
- Platform: tvOS 18.0+ (confirmed 18.1, 18.2, 18.4)
- Hardware: Apple TV 4K (A12, A15, A16 generations)

## Summary
VoiceOver focus navigation causes system-wide event queue overflow leading to uncontrolled phantom navigation that persists after app termination. Device restart required for recovery.

Real-World Occurrences: Issue confirmed in production apps including Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, and Paramount+.

## Impact
- VoiceOver users experience complete system failure
- Focus navigation becomes uncontrollable across all apps  
- No software recovery possible - requires device restart
- Affects entire tvOS focus system, not app-specific
- Production apps affected: Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+ confirmed

## Reproduction Methods

### Method 1: Manual Progressive Stress (~190 seconds)
Most Reliable - Multiple confirmed reproductions

Phases:
1. 0-60s: Right-dominant navigation (75% right, 25% down)
2. 60-120s: Sustained bidirectional patterns
3. 120-180s: Intensive navigation until critical stalls appear
4. 180s+: System failure at 5,000ms+ stall threshold

Critical Indicators:
- Memory escalation: 52MB → 79MB
- RunLoop stalls: 1,919ms → 4,127ms → 5,179ms (failure)
- Event queue overflow: 205+ events, negative counts (-44 to -76)
- Success Rate: Moderate - multiple documented successes with proper conditions

### Method 2: UITest Automation (<130 seconds when successful)
Limited Reliability - Single confirmed success

Setup:
1. Enable VoiceOver: Settings → Accessibility → VoiceOver → On
2. Deploy HammerTime test app with `heavyReproduction` preset
3. Launch UITest: `testEvolvedInfinityBugReproduction`

Results (when successful):
- Peak RunLoop Stall: 40,124ms (667× normal frame budget)
- Timeline: Critical failure in <130 seconds
- Memory: 150MB+ allocation stress
- Success Rate: ~5% (1 success out of 18+ attempts)

## Expected vs Actual Behavior

Expected:
- Navigation stops when user input ceases
- RunLoop stalls <33ms (60fps budget)
- App termination clears navigation state
- Focus remains responsive system-wide

Actual:
- Phantom navigation continues without input
- RunLoop stalls 40,124ms+ (1200× budget)
- App termination fails to clear event queue
- System-wide focus failure requiring restart

## Technical Evidence

Critical Performance Data:
```
Manual Method (Primary/Reliable):
Memory: 52MB baseline → 79MB failure
Queue: 42 events → 205 events overflow  
Peak:   5,179ms stall triggers cascade failure
Success Rate: Moderate - multiple documented reproductions with proper conditions

UITest Method (Single Success):
t=43s:  11,066ms - First critical stall
t=173s: 40,124ms - Peak system failure
Result: 30+ stalls >10,000ms each
Success Rate: ~5% (1 success out of 18+ attempts)
```

Root Cause Analysis:
- VoiceOver accessibility processing adds 15-25ms per navigation event
- Sustained input overwhelms main RunLoop event processing
- Event queue saturation creates background persistence
- System-wide focus hierarchy corruption occurs

## Configuration Requirements

Essential for Reproduction:
- Physical Apple TV device (Simulator cannot reproduce)
- VoiceOver enabled before app launch
- Complex focus hierarchy (50+ focusable elements)
- Sustained navigation (1-3 minutes minimum)

HammerTime Test Configuration:
```swift
// High-stress reproduction preset
-FocusStressPreset "heavyReproduction"

// Configuration details:
- 50×50 sections (2,500 elements)
- Triple-nested compositional layouts
- 15 hidden accessibility traps per cell
- 0.05s jiggle timer (constant layout changes)
- Circular focus guides creating navigation conflicts
```

## System Recovery

Failed Recovery Methods:
- Menu + Home button combinations
- App termination/force quit
- Settings app navigation
- Accessibility settings toggle

Required Recovery:
- Device restart (power cycle) - only effective method
- 60+ second recovery time
- All user data/session state lost

## Attachments

Required Evidence Package:
1. HammerTime.xcodeproj - Complete reproduction project
2. Console logs - 40,124ms stall sequence with timestamps  
3. Instruments traces - RunLoop performance during failure
4. Screen recording - Phantom navigation demonstration
5. Sysdiagnose - System state during failure
6. Memory profiling - 52MB→79MB escalation pattern

## Engineering Notes

For Apple Investigation:
- Issue is VoiceOver-specific - does not occur without accessibility
- Timing-sensitive - requires natural human input intervals (200-800ms)
- Hardware-dependent - physical Apple TV required for reproduction  
- System-level - affects CFRunLoop processing, not app-specific
- Queue overflow - event processing continues in background after app termination
- Production impact confirmed - Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+ affected

Suggested Investigation Areas:
1. VoiceOver event queue management in accessibility framework
2. Main RunLoop stall recovery mechanisms under load
3. Focus hierarchy processing optimization for complex layouts
4. Event queue flushing on app lifecycle transitions

Proposed Mitigation:
Implement emergency queue flush when VoiceOver processing backlog exceeds 5,000ms within 30-second window.
