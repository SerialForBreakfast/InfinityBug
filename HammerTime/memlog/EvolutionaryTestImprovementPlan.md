Simple Evolutionary Test Improvement Plan:
	1.	Run Current Tests
	•	Clearly record which tests trigger the InfinityBug and which don’t.
	2.	Select Best Tests
	•	Keep tests that have triggered (or almost triggered) the bug.
	•	Remove tests consistently failing to trigger the bug.
	3.	Modify Promising Tests
	•	Adjust inputs, timing, or stressors slightly to improve chances of triggering the bug.
	4.	Combine Successful Patterns
	•	Create new tests by combining the best parts of multiple promising tests.
	5.	Repeat
	•	Run the updated tests again.
	•	Keep refining based on results until consistently reproducing the InfinityBug.
