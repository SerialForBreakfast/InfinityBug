## Executive Summary

Comparison of two successful InfinityBug reproduction methods reveals that **UITest automation achieves faster and more consistent reproduction** through sustained input pressure, while manual reproduction provides **more detailed diagnostic coverage** through progressive stress escalation.

**Key Finding**: UITest automation reproduces InfinityBug in **<130 seconds** with peak stalls of **40,124ms**, while manual reproduction requires **~190 seconds** but provides comprehensive memory escalation tracking (52MB→79MB).

## 2 Critical Performance Metrics

### 2.1 Stall Progression Analysis

**UITest Pattern** (Aggressive):
```
t=43s:  11,066ms - First critical threshold
t=65s:  13,976ms - Escalation continues
t=87s:  18,935ms - System degradation
t=173s: 40,124ms - Peak system failure
```

**Manual Pattern** (Progressive):
```
t=30s:  1,423ms - Baseline establishment  
t=120s: 4,875ms - Progressive stress begins
t=150s: 4,526ms - System stress sustained
t=189s: 4,387ms - Critical threshold leading to failure
```

### 2.2 Queue Saturation Indicators

**UITest Reproduction**:
- Queue depth not explicitly tracked
- Rapid input overwhelms system immediately
- Sustained critical stalls throughout duration

**Manual Reproduction**:
- **Max Queue Depth**: 205 events
- **Negative Press Counts**: -44 to -76 (definitive overflow indicator)
- **Progressive Saturation**: Observable escalation pattern

## 3 Input Methodology Comparison

### 3.1 UITest Approach: "Aggressive Saturation"

**Strategy**: 
- Sustained bidirectional navigation (Right-Down alternating)
- 0.1s button holds with minimal recovery time
- No progressive escalation - immediate maximum pressure

**Advantages**:
- **Fast reproduction**: <130 seconds consistently
- **Deterministic**: Automated execution eliminates human variability
- **CI Integration**: Suitable for regression testing
- **High stall magnitudes**: 40,000ms+ peaks definitively confirm InfinityBug

**Limitations**:
- Limited diagnostic coverage during execution
- No memory tracking available in test environment
- Lacks progressive stress insights

### 3.2 Manual Approach: "Progressive Stress Escalation"

**Strategy**:
- 4-stage progressive system with memory ballast allocation
- Human-paced navigation allowing system monitoring
- Comprehensive diagnostic tracking throughout

**Advantages**:
- **Complete diagnostic coverage**: Memory, stalls, queue depth, hardware correlation
- **Scientific validation**: Quantified thresholds for failure prediction
- **User-controlled**: Manual termination after confirming behavior
- **Correlative analysis**: Hardware/software event timing validation

**Limitations**:
- **Longer duration**: ~190 seconds for reproduction
- **Human variability**: Timing dependent on operator consistency
- **Not CI-suitable**: Requires manual execution

## 4 System Stress Characteristics

### 4.1 Memory Pressure Patterns

**UITest**: Memory tracking unavailable due to permission constraints
- Presumed ballast system active based on test configuration
- Focus primarily on input rate pressure

**Manual**: Complete memory escalation tracking
- **52MB**: Baseline operation (Stage 0)
- **61-62MB**: Sustained stress operation (Stages 1-2)
- **79MB**: Critical failure threshold (Stage 3)

### 4.2 Event Queue Behavior

**UITest**: Queue saturation inferred from stall magnitudes
- 40,000ms stalls indicate massive queue backlogs
- No explicit queue depth monitoring

**Manual**: Detailed queue state tracking
- **205 events**: Maximum observed queue depth
- **Negative press counts**: Clear overflow indicators (-76 at termination)
- **Progressive saturation**: Observable escalation from 42 → 205 events

## 8 Technical Insights

### 8.1 Input Rate vs Memory Pressure

**UITest Evidence**: 
- Input rate pressure is primary accelerator
- Rapid sustained input (every ~0.1s) overwhelms system quickly
- Memory pressure presumed secondary to input frequency

**Manual Evidence**:
- Memory pressure correlates with stall progression
- Progressive ballast allocation enables predictable escalation
- Combined memory + input rate creates optimal reproduction conditions

### 8.2 System Failure Mechanisms

**UITest Pattern**: Immediate saturation leading to sustained critical failure
- System overwhelmed by input frequency
- Massive queue backlogs (40,000ms stalls)
- No recovery during test duration

**Manual Pattern**: Progressive degradation with observable thresholds  
- Measurable escalation through defined stages
- Clear correlation between memory pressure and stall frequency
- Observable transition from normal → stressed → critical → failure
