HammerTime Enhanced Stress Patterns Usage Guide
=================================================

This guide explains how to use the Enhanced Stress Patterns in FocusStressViewController
to debug and reproduce the InfinityBug in tvOS applications.

The InfinityBug occurs when VoiceOver focus gets stuck repeating button presses infinitely,
even after the application is closed. These stress patterns recreate the conditions that
trigger this bug by overwhelming the accessibility and focus systems.

CONFIGURATION SYSTEM
====================

The stress patterns are controlled via FocusStressConfiguration using presets:

Available Presets:
- lightExploration: Minimal stress (10x10 sections, no stressors)
- mediumStress: Moderate stress (25x35 sections, basic stressors) 
- heavyReproduction: High stress (50x50 sections, all stressors)
- edgeTesting: Edge case focus testing (20x20 sections, specific stressors)
- performanceBaseline: Performance testing (100x100 sections, no stressors)
- guaranteedInfinityBug: Maximum stress (150x150 sections, all stressors, aggressive timings)

To set a preset, use launch arguments:
-FocusStressPreset "guaranteedInfinityBug"

ENHANCED STRESS PATTERNS
========================

1. NESTED LAYOUT STRUCTURES
---------------------------
What it does:
Creates complex compositional layout hierarchies that stress the focus calculation system.

Layout Levels:
- simple: Single item per group
- nested: Item -> Horizontal Group -> Vertical Group  
- tripleNested: Item -> Horizontal Group -> Vertical Group -> Outer Group

How to adjust:
Change LayoutConfiguration.nestingLevel in your preset configuration.

Impact on InfinityBug:
Complex nested layouts force the focus engine to perform expensive calculations.
Triple-nested layouts with 150x150 sections create the computational load seen
in successful reproductions. The focus system struggles with deep hierarchy
traversal, leading to stalls that can escalate to InfinityBug conditions.

Configuration parameters:
- numberOfSections: Number of collection view sections (10-150)
- itemsPerSection: Items per section (10-150)
- nestingLevel: Layout complexity (.simple, .nested, .tripleNested)

2. HIDDEN/VISIBLE FOCUSABLE TRAPS
---------------------------------
What it does:
Scatters 15 nearly-invisible focusable elements throughout each cell with
conflicting accessibility properties and duplicate labels.

How to adjust:
Enable/disable via StressorConfiguration.stressors.contains(.hiddenFocusableTraps)
Number of traps per cell is hardcoded to 15 in StressCell.configure()

Impact on InfinityBug:
Hidden focusable elements create accessibility tree inconsistencies. The system
becomes confused about which elements are actually focusable, leading to focus
calculation errors. Duplicate accessibility labels ("HiddenTrap0", "HiddenTrap1", etc.)
further stress the VoiceOver system's element identification.

Technical details:
- 15 trap views per cell (increased from 8 for "AGGRESSIVE" mode)
- Random visibility (isHidden = Bool.random())
- Alpha 0.05 for visible traps, 0 for hidden
- Conflicting accessibility traits [.button, .image, .selected]
- Overlapping 25x20 point frames

3. JIGGLE TIMER (CONSTANT LAYOUT CHANGES)
-----------------------------------------
What it does:
Continuously modifies autolayout constraints every few milliseconds, causing
constant layout recalculation during navigation.

How to adjust:
- Enable: Add .jiggleTimer to stressors set
- Timing: Modify StressorConfiguration.jiggleInterval (default 0.05s)
- Extreme: guaranteedInfinityBug preset uses 0.015s

Impact on InfinityBug:
Constant layout changes force the accessibility system to recalculate the
element tree repeatedly. Combined with navigation, this creates the "layout
thrashing" condition observed in successful reproductions where memory usage
escalates and stalls become longer.

Implementation:
Timer alternates topConstraint.constant between 0 and 8 points, triggering
UIView.performWithoutAnimation layout updates.

4. CIRCULAR FOCUS GUIDES 
------------------------
What it does:
Creates multiple UIFocusGuide objects with overlapping preferred environments,
causing circular focus reference chains.

How to adjust:
Enable via .circularFocusGuides in stressors set.
Number of guides and positioning are hardcoded in addCircularGuides().

Impact on InfinityBug:
Circular references in focus guides create infinite loops in focus calculation.
When the focus system tries to determine the next focusable element, it can
get trapped in circular dependency chains, leading to the infinite focus
movement characteristic of InfinityBug.

Technical details:
- 2 overlapping 1x1 point focus guides
- Both reference the same collectionView as preferredFocusEnvironment
- Positioned at (10,10) and (12,12) points from top-left

5. DUPLICATE ACCESSIBILITY IDENTIFIERS
--------------------------------------
What it does:
Assigns the same accessibilityIdentifier ("dupCell") to multiple cells
based on indexPath.item % 3 == 0.

How to adjust:
Enable via .duplicateIdentifiers in stressors set.
Duplication logic is in StressCell.configure().

Impact on InfinityBug:
Duplicate IDs confuse the accessibility system's element tracking.
VoiceOver relies on unique identifiers for navigation state management.
When multiple elements have identical IDs, the system can lose track
of the current focus position, leading to erratic focus behavior.

6. DYNAMIC FOCUS GUIDES (RAPIDLY CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS)
-------------------------------------------------------
What it does:
Creates 5 focus guides that rapidly change their preferredFocusEnvironments
every few milliseconds between collectionView, view, and self.

How to adjust:
- Enable: Add .dynamicFocusGuides to stressors
- Timing: Modify dynamicGuideInterval (default 0.1s, extreme 0.03s)

Impact on InfinityBug:
Rapidly changing focus environments create race conditions in focus calculation.
The focus system struggles to maintain consistency when preferred environments
change faster than it can process them, leading to focus state corruption.

Technical details:
- 5 guides positioned at (20+i*5, 20+i*5) points
- Random selection from [collectionView, view, self] every interval
- Extreme preset uses 30ms intervals for maximum chaos

7. RAPID LAYOUT INVALIDATION CYCLES
-----------------------------------
What it does:
Forces collection view layout invalidation at high frequency, overwhelming
the layout calculation system.

How to adjust:
- Enable: Add .rapidLayoutChanges to stressors
- Timing: Modify layoutChangeInterval (default 0.03s, extreme 0.008s)

Impact on InfinityBug:
Rapid layout invalidation creates sustained main thread pressure.
Each invalidation triggers expensive focus environment recalculation.
The extreme preset (8ms intervals) can saturate the main thread,
creating the stall conditions necessary for InfinityBug reproduction.

Implementation:
Timer calls collectionView.collectionViewLayout.invalidateLayout(),
collectionView.setNeedsLayout(), and view.setNeedsLayout() every interval.

8. OVERLAPPING INVISIBLE FOCUSABLE ELEMENTS
-------------------------------------------
What it does:
Adds 50+ nearly-invisible focusable views with overlapping frames
and conflicting accessibility properties.

How to adjust:
Enable via .overlappingElements in stressors set.
Count and positioning are hardcoded in addOverlappingElements().

Impact on InfinityBug:
Overlapping elements create ambiguous focus targets. The accessibility
system struggles to determine which element should receive focus when
multiple elements occupy the same screen region. This leads to focus
calculation errors and potential infinite loops.

Technical details:
- 50 overlay views with alpha 0.01 (nearly invisible)
- 300x200 point frames with aggressive overlap
- Duplicate labels ("Overlay0" through "Overlay4")
- Mixed accessibility traits for system confusion

9. VOICEOVER ANNOUNCEMENTS
--------------------------
What it does:
Posts random VoiceOver announcements and layout change notifications
to stress the accessibility system.

How to adjust:
- Enable: Add .voAnnouncements to stressors
- Timing: Modify voAnnouncementInterval (default 0.3s, extreme 0.12s)

Impact on InfinityBug:
Constant accessibility announcements overwhelm VoiceOver's processing queue.
Layout change notifications (15% probability) force accessibility tree
recalculation while triggering actual layout invalidation, creating the
dual processing load observed in successful reproductions.

Enhanced features for reproduction:
- Layout change announcements trigger real layout invalidation
- Forces focus system recalculation via setNeedsFocusUpdate()
- Stress announcements during cell configuration for maximum impact

PROGRESSIVE STRESS SYSTEM
=========================

What it does:
Systematically escalates system stress over time to predictably reproduce
InfinityBug conditions based on successful reproduction patterns.

Timeline and Targets:
- 0-30s: Baseline (~52MB, normal operation)
- 30-90s: Level 1 (~56MB, 1-2s stalls)
- 90-180s: Level 2 (~64MB, 5-10s stalls)  
- 180s+: Level 3 (65-66MB, sustained 1000ms+ stalls → InfinityBug)

How to adjust:
Automatically activated in FocusStressViewController.
Timing thresholds are hardcoded in updateProgressiveStress().

Memory pressure implementation:
- Adds 1MB string arrays to reach target memory usage
- Simulates VoiceOver overhead with accessibility tree queries
- Injects artificial stalls (Thread.sleep) to trigger longer system stalls

Impact on InfinityBug:
Reproduces the exact memory and timing conditions observed in successful
manual reproductions. The predictable escalation ensures that critical
thresholds (64-66MB memory usage) are reached systematically rather
than randomly.

MEMORY STRESS FEATURES
=====================

Continuous Memory Allocation:
Activated automatically for extreme presets (guaranteedInfinityBug).
Creates background memory pressure through continuous allocation cycles.

How it works:
- Background thread allocates 50,000 UUID strings every 25-100ms
- Main thread processes allocations to create memory pressure
- Progressive allocation frequency (starts 100ms, reduces to 25ms)

Impact on InfinityBug:
Memory pressure creates the system conditions necessary for InfinityBug.
Successful reproductions consistently show memory usage of 64-66MB.
The continuous allocation stress maintains this pressure throughout testing.

PRESET RECOMMENDATIONS
======================

For InfinityBug Reproduction:
1. guaranteedInfinityBug: Maximum stress with all patterns enabled
2. heavyReproduction: High stress for general reproduction testing
3. mediumStress: Moderate stress for initial testing

For Debugging Specific Issues:
1. edgeTesting: Focus edge cases (circularFocusGuides + overlappingElements)
2. performanceBaseline: Isolate performance vs. accessibility issues
3. lightExploration: Minimal stress for baseline comparison

USAGE EXAMPLES
==============

Manual Testing:
Launch with: -FocusStressPreset "guaranteedInfinityBug"
Enable VoiceOver before execution (required for accessibility stress)
Monitor system behavior for 3+ minutes to reach critical stress levels

UI Testing:
Set environment variable: FOCUS_TEST_MODE=1
Use XCUIApplication.launchArguments = ["-FocusStressPreset", "heavyReproduction"]

Custom Configuration:
Modify FocusStressConfiguration presets or create new presets
Focus on specific stressor combinations for targeted testing

DEBUGGING TIPS
==============

1. Enable comprehensive logging via TestRunLogger.shared
2. Monitor memory usage - target 64-66MB for reproduction conditions
3. Watch for stall escalation: normal → 1-2s → 5-10s → 1000ms+ (InfinityBug)
4. VoiceOver must be enabled on device before test execution
5. Real device testing required - Simulator doesn't accurately reproduce accessibility stress

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If InfinityBug doesn't reproduce:
1. Verify VoiceOver is enabled on physical device
2. Increase stress pattern timing (lower interval values)
3. Use guaranteedInfinityBug preset for maximum stress
4. Ensure tests run for 3+ minutes to reach critical stress levels
5. Check memory pressure - should reach 64+ MB

Performance Impact:
These stress patterns intentionally degrade performance to reproduce bugs.
Normal application performance will be severely impacted.
Only use in dedicated debugging environments.
